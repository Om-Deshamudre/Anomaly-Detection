#De-Anonymization of Illegal Cryptocurrency Transactions
##Description:
This project aims to address the challenge of identifying and de-anonymizing illegal cryptocurrency transactions using anomaly detection techniques implemented in Python. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, there has been a corresponding increase in illicit activities such as money laundering, fraud, and illicit transactions. Traditional financial institutions often struggle to trace and monitor these transactions due to the inherent anonymity of cryptocurrencies. This project leverages anomaly detection algorithms to detect suspicious patterns and behaviors within cryptocurrency transactions, ultimately aiding in the identification and prevention of illegal activities.

##Key Features:
1.Anomaly Detection: Utilizes advanced anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual patterns or behaviors within cryptocurrency transactions.
2.De-Anonymization: Analyzes transaction data to uncover potential links between anonymous wallets and illicit activities, facilitating the de-anonymization process.
3.Python Implementation: Entirely implemented in Python, making it accessible and customizable for users with varying levels of programming expertise.
4.Scalability: Designed to handle large volumes of transaction data, enabling efficient processing and analysis of cryptocurrency networks.
5.Visualization: Provides visualization tools to illustrate detected anomalies and highlight suspicious transactions for further investigation.
